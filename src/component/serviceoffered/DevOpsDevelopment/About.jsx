It emphasizes automation, continuous integration, and continuous deployment (CI/CD), allowing businesses to streamline workflows and reduce manual errors. By implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC), organizations can manage infrastructure through automation, ensuring consistency and scalability.</p>
                                                               <p>A key aspect of DevOps is real-time monitoring and logging, which helps teams detect and resolve issues proactively. Security is also integrated into the DevOps pipeline through DevSecOps, embedding security checks at every stage of development. Additionally, containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes simplify application deployment across different environments.</p>
